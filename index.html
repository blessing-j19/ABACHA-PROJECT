        <p class="about-paragraph"> African Salad (locally known as Abacha) is one of the meals that mostly prepared and enjoyed by the Ibo speaking people of Nigeria. Its native taste is so distinctive, making it a delicacy to be enjoyed by all. It is usually served as a side dish in special events such as traditional weddings, burial ceremonies, anniversaries or the visit of a special guest. It is best served with Palm wine, a local drink tapped from special palm trees, but you can also enjoy it with any chilled drink of choice. </p>
